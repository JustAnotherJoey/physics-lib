    "Maxwell's Equations are a set of differential equations (or integral equations if you are in to that stuff) that can be used to formulate and describe classical E&M theory. In particular, they tell us how charges and currents generate electric and magentic fields, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many traditional treatments of E&M begin with Coloumb's Law and a variety of seemingly scattered electrical phenomanae that would eventually get unified under these equations. My opinion is that this approach is great for getting a good physical intuition of isolated phenomanae. Richard Feynman, in his infamous Feynman Lecture's, begins with Maxwell's Equations. My opinion is that this approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of E&M phenomanae from the start and gives people a good idea of the toolkit that they will be using, namely differential equations (or integral equations if you are a little math demon). \n",

    "$$ \\nabla \\times \\textbf{B} = \\frac{1}{c} (4\\pi\\textbf{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\textbf{E}}{\\partial t}) $$\n",
