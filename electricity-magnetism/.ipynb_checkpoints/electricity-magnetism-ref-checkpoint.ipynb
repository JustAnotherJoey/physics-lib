    "The beginning of E&M must begin with the introduction of the fundamental property of charge. Charge is a property of matter that influences how it interacts with other matter. Just as the mass of an object will impact its dynamics and how it interacts with other pieces of matter with mass, charge will do the same thing. Charge is a fundamental property of matter, but it can be difficult to understand relative to other fundamental properties since it is not a fundamental property that people have much anecdotal experience (although the advent of cheap technology has increased this familiariaty somewhat). For example, most people have anecdotal experience moving objects with a variety of differnt masses and observing how the weight of the object and the distribution of that weight impacts how it will move. A lot fewer people have anecdotal experience dealing with charged objects, but there are areas in which people have some experience. If you were fortunate, you had the opportunity to play with a balloon or comb your hair as a kid, and each of those experiences allow people to experiment with charge first hand (Vigorously rub either object on your hair and notice that if you stick that object toward another friend's hair without touching, the hair will have an observable reaction). Although the property of charge is one that can be taken for granted by many, it is of significant practical importance. Electrons, small particles that have charge, are the basis for many of the chemical reactions that occur between different types of matter. The periodic table of elements is arranged in a way where elements of a given column have a similar valence shell profile of electrons. The structure of the valence shell of matter is one of the most important factors that goes into determining how matter will interact with other matter.\n",

    "Two charges exert a force on each other that is proportional to the inverse square of the distance of those two charges. Moreover, the force exerted on a particular charge by a group of charges is the sum of forces exerted by each of the pairs of charges. The relationship between force, charge, and distance is known as Coloumb's Law and this neat property of calculating the force due to groups of charges is known as linearity. We denote Coloumb's law as \n",
    "$$ F_e = k * \\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} $$\n",
    "where k is the proportionality constant, the q's are the respective charges, and r is the radial distance between the two charges. \n",
    "\n",
    "All electric charges create an electric field. Electric fields exert forces on charged matter. The electric field created by a point charge can be represented as \n",
    "$$ E_e = \\frac{k*q}{r^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric fields have flux through regions of space that depend entirely on the charge enclosed within that region of space. We represent this as \n",
    "$$ \\Psi_e = \\int E \\cdot dA = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n",

    "The work done by an electric field or done by the electrostatic force by a charged particle is defined as \n",

    "For a uniform electric field, this is \n",

    "As we have seen above, static charges create electric fields that exert forces on other charged particles where the electric field is not zero. Charged particles can also appear to create another distinct force when the charged particle moves in a system. The force that a moving charged particle exerts on another charged particle (moving or static) is always perpendicular to the direction of motion of the moving particle as well as the direction of the magnetic field at that point. This force has been named the magnetic force, and the strength of the force produced by a moving charge is proportional to the charge and velocity of the particle and the strength of the magnetic field at that point in space. The strength of the magnetic field is determined by factors such as the charge distribution, geometry of the charges, and the magnitude of changes in the electric field.  \n",

    "$$ F_m = (qv) \\times B  $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For a moving point charge, the magnetic field is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B = \\frac{\\mu_0 q v \\times r}{4\\pi r^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total force exerted on a charged particle is the combination of force created by the electric field and the magnetic field created by the superposition of all of the charged particles and there respective electromagnetic fields. It is important to emphasize that moving charges have both an electric field and a magnetic field. Charged particles always have some electric field, and it is the motion of the particle (or the system relative to the particle) that results in the magnetic force. \n",
    "\n",
    "Magnetic fields, just like electric fields, can be thought of as flowing through space, but unlike electric fields, there are no magnetic monopoles. A single particle, such as an electron or positron, can be thought of as a point particle with negative or positive charge. This means that we can divide a piece of mass into smaller and smaller pieces until we get to a point in which all unique charged particles are confined to a region of space. No matter how small we divide a piece of magnetized material, however, there will be a magnetic north and magentic south region of the particle or no magnetic moment at all. Therefore, the magnetic flux enclosed within ANY closed surface is 0. This property is called Gauss's Law for Magnetism, which is expressed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Psi_b = \\int B \\cdot dA = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted before, the force that a magentic field exerts on a charged particle is mutually orthogonal to both the direction of motion and the direction of the magnetic field. This implies that a magnetic field cannot do work on a particle, since the direction of the force is orthogonal to the direction of movement (recall that work is defined such that work is done when a force occurs in the same direction of movement). There are cases, however, where a non-conservative field can exist and the magnetic force can do work on a particle. This only occurs when there is a time-varying current or a space varying surface that causes alterations in the electric and magnetic fields in a given region of space.\n",

    "Although we have described electric fields and magnetic fields in isolated contexts, they are actually two sides of one fundamental phenomenae. We call this force the electromagnetic force. The total force exerted on a charged particle due to electric fields and magnetic fields is \n",

    "Maxwell's Equations are a set of differential equations (or integral equations if you are in to that stuff) that can be used to formulate and describe classical E&M theory. In particular, they tell us how charges and currents generate electric and magentic fields, respectively. \n",

    "Many traditional treatments of E&M begin with Coloumb's Law and a variety of seemingly scattered electrical phenomanae that would eventually get unified under these equations. My opinion is that this approach is great for getting a good physical intuition of isolated phenomanae. Richard Feynman, in his infamous Feynman Lecture's, begins with Maxwell's Equations. My opinion is that this approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of E&M phenomanae from the start and gives people a good idea of the toolkit that they will be using, namely differential equations (or integral equations if you are a little math demon). \n",
